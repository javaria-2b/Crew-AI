# The Future - Multi Modal Agents

AI agents are autonomous entities that use artificial intelligence to perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals. They can operate in various domains, such as natural language processing, robotics, game playing, and more.
These LLMs that can talk to themselves, we can have multiple agents hooked up (They can pass tasks to each other)

### Executing the code:
For testing these agents by yourselves, you can simply clone this repo by the command:
```
git clone https://github.com/javaria-2b/Crew-AI.git
```

> Remember to add your openAI and SERPER_API_KEY in utils file.(You will create utils file by yourself!)
